# Hackerman Text, the AI-native code editor 

Hackerman Text is built on a simple principle: make typing feel instant, then stay out of your way.

Non-essential features are on-demand by default. There are no distracting squiggles.

Most things behave as you'd expect, no learning curve. Focus on a single file, or open multiple files into a single view. Every view stays in sync and always shows the latest version of your files.

Your configuration lives in plain text, so it can be version-controlled, shared across machines, or stored in the cloud.
