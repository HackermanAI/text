* Hackerman Text, the AI-native code editor

/Local-first AI. Zero-latency typing. No telemetry, no sign in./

*Highlights*

- Minimal UI
- Built-in, native-level lexers
- Inline AI chat
- Fast code completions using local models
- Context-aware autocomplete
- Platform-default key bindings (everything is a function and bindable)
- Write your own editor commands in a small, well-defined subset of Python
- Project-wide file finder and search 


** Getting started guide

| Key binding                                   | Function |
| `Command + E` (⌘E)                            | File explorer (drop folder on editor or edit config file to update root directory) |
| `Command + Shift + E` (⌘⇧E)                   | File outline for quick overview and navigation |
| `Command + P` (⌘P)                            | Open buffers (same as tab list, if hidden) |
| `Command + Shift + P` (⌘⇧P, or right click)   | Function explorer with all editor functions and key bindings |
| `Command + F` (⌘F)                            | Find in file |
| `Command + Shift + F` (⌘⇧F)                   | Project-wide search (hit enter in search input to export as org-file) |
| `Command + W` (⌘W)                            | Toggle split view (shared document with open buffer) |

Other useful default key bindings to get you started:

- `Shift + Click` on file names in title to open many (stacked horizontally)
- `DoubleCLick` (⌘L, or `Command + L`) on line number to fold code
